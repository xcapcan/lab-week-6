<p>Site personality:
Inspiring, hipster, edgy, fashionable
It should make the person feel inspired and passionate about improving their style</p>
<p>Limitations:
I haven’t really thought of any major limitations, but screen readers should be fine if I put alts for the pictures, that way it will be available for everyone.
Since it’s a younger audience, there shouldn’t be any limitation about the knowledge of using the device, but it should still be easy enough to understand.</p>
